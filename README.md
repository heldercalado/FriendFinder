# FriendFinder

This Project's Objective was to present 10 questions to the user and use an algorithm to compare with the other users 
responses and return the one user that answered the closest (a match).

for this task , I've used the library Brain.js (https://www.npmjs.com/package/brainjs) , it uses machine learning to calculate based
on feed foward neural network scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) 
I've used as training the previous users inputs plus a set of randomly generated users.
after the "learning" process is done it compares with 10 decimals precision the user that matches and returns the user name and a picture.
